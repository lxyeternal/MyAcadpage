Yuqiang Sun (孙宇强 in Chinese) is now a Ph.D. student in School of Computer Science and Engineering @ Nanyang Technological University, supervised by [Prof. Yang Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/).
Before Ph.D. study, he got his bachelor degree in Sichuan University.
His research interests include program analysis, vulnerability detection and patch generation.
He hopes to collaborate with more innovative researchers on various exciting topics in software engineering, program analysis, vulnerability detection, and program synthesis.

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KAWDTzsAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KAWDTzsAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
